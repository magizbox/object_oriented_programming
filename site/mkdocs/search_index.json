            "text": "Apache Nutch\n\n\n\n  \nHighly extensible, highly scalable Web crawler \n1\n Nutch is a well matured, production ready Web crawler. Nutch 1.x enables fine grained configuration, relying on Apache Hadoop\u2122 data structures, which are great for batch processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\nUsecases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n Features \n1\n \n\n\n\n1\n Transparency\n Nutch is open source, so anyone can see how the ranking algorithms work. With commercial search engines, the precise details of the algorithms are secret so you can never know why a particular search result is ranked as it is. Furthermore, some search engines allow rankings to be based on payments, rather than on the relevance of the site's contents. Nutch is a good fit for academic and government organizations, where the perception of fairness of rankings may be more important.\n\n\n\n2\n Understanding\n We don't have the source code to Google, so Nutch is probably the best we have. It's interesting to see how a large search engine works. Nutch has been built using ideas from academia and industry: for instance, core parts of Nutch are currently being re-implemented to use the \nMapReduce\n.\n\n\n\nMap Reduce distributed processing model, which emerged from Google Labs last year. And Nutch is attractive for researchers who want to try out new search algorithms, since it is so easy to extend.\n\n\n\n3\n Extensibility\n Don't like the way other search engines display their results? Write your own search engine--using Nutch! Nutch is very flexible: it can be customized and incorporated into your application. For developers, Nutch is a great platform for adding search to heterogeneous collections of information, and being able to customize the search interface, or extend the out-of-the-box functionality through the plugin mechanism. For example, you can integrate it into your site to add a search capability.\n\n\n\nProcess \n5\n\n\n\n0\n initialize CrawlDb, inject \nseed\n URLs Repeat \ngenerate-fetch-update\n cycle n times:\n\n\n\n1\n The \nInjector\n takes all the URLs of the nutch.txt file and adds them to the \nCrawlDB\n. As a central part of Nutch, the \nCrawlDB\n maintains information on all known URLs (fetch schedule, fetch status, metadata, \u2026).\n\n\n\n2\n Based on the data of \nCrawlDB\n, the \nGenerator\n creates a fetchlist and places it in a newly created \nSegment directory\n.\n\n\n\n3\n Next, the \nFetcher\n gets the content of the URLs on the fetchlist and writes it back to the \nSegment directory\n. This step usually is the most time-consuming one.\n\n\n\n4\n Now the \nParser\n processes the content of each web page and for example omits all html tags. If the crawl functions as an update or an extension to an already existing one (e.g. depth of 3), the \nUpdater\n would add the new data to the \nCrawlDB\n as a next step.\n\n\n\n5\n Before indexing, all the links need to be inverted by \nLink Inverter\n, which takes into account that not the number of outgoing links of a web page is of interest, but rather the number of inbound links. This is quite similar to how Google PageRank works and is important for the scoring function. The inverted links are saved in the \nLinkdb\n.\n\n\n\n6-7.\n Using data from all possible sources (\nCrawlDB\n, \nLinkDB\n and \nSegments\n), the \nIndexer\n creates an index and saves it within the Solr directory. For indexing, the popular Lucene library is used. Now, the user can search for information regarding the crawled web pages via Solr.\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n1.\n OpenJDK 7\n\n\n2.\n Nutch 2.3 RC (yes, you need 2.3, 2.2 will not work)\n\n\nwget https://archive.apache.org/dist/nutch/2.3/apache-nutch-2.3-src.tar.gz\ntar -xzf apache-nutch-2.3-src.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n3.\n HBase 0.94.27 (HBase 0.98 won't work)\n\n\nwget https://www.apache.org/dist/hbase/hbase-0.94.27/hbase-0.94.27.tar.gz\ntar -xzf hbase-0.94.27.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n4.\n ElasticSearch 1.7\n\n\nwget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.7.0.tar.gz\ntar -xzf elasticsearch-1.7.0.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\nOther Options: \nnutch-2.3\n, \nhbase-0.94.26\n, \nElasticSearch 1.4\n\n\nSetup HBase\n\n\n1\n edit \n$HBASE_ROOT/conf/hbase-site.xml\n and add\n\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n    \nproperty\n\n        \nname\nhbase.rootdir\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\nfile:///full/path/to/where/the/data/should/be/stored\n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n    \nproperty\n\n        \nname\nhbase.cluster.distributed\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\nfalse\n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n edit \n$HBASE_ROOT/conf/hbase-env.sh\n and enable \nJAVA_HOME\n and set it to the proper path:\n\n\n\n-# export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.6.0/\n+export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/\n\n\n\n\nThis step might seem redundant, but even with \nJAVA_HOME\n being set in my shell, HBase just didn't recognize it.\n\n\n\n3\n kick off HBase:\n\n\n\n$ $HBASE_ROOT/bin/start-hbase.sh\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Nutch\n\n\n1.\n Enable the HBase dependency in \n$NUTCH_ROOT/ivy/ivy.xml\n by uncommenting the line\n\n\ndependency org=\norg.apache.gora\n name=\ngora-hbase\n rev=\n0.5\n conf=\n*-\ndefault\n /\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n Configure the HBase adapter by editing the \n$NUTCH_ROOT/conf/gora.properties\n\n\n-#gora.datastore.default=org.apache.gora.mock.store.MockDataStore\n+gora.datastore.default=org.apache.gora.hbase.store.HBaseStore\n\n\n\n\n3.\n Build Nutch\n\n\n$ cd $NUTCH_ROOT \n ant clean \n ant runtime\n\n\n\n\nThis can take a while and creates \n$NUTCH_ROOT/runtime/local\n.\n\n\n\n4.\n configure Nutch by editing \n$NUTCH_ROOT/runtime/local/conf/nutch-site.xml\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n    \nproperty\n\n        \nname\nhttp.agent.name\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\nmycrawlername\n/value\n\n        \n!-- this can be changed to something more sane if you like --\n\n    \n/property\n\n    \nproperty\n\n        \nname\nhttp.robots.agents\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\nmycrawlername\n/value\n\n        \n!-- this is the robot name we're looking for in robots.txt files --\n\n    \n/property\n\n    \nproperty\n\n        \nname\nstorage.data.store.class\n/name\n\n        \nvalue\norg.apache.gora.hbase.store.HBaseStore\n/value\n\n    \n/property\n\n    \nproperty\n\n        \nname\nplugin.includes\n/name\n\n        \n!-- do \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* enable the parse-html plugin, if you want proper HTML parsing.

The core Nutch extension-points are themselves defined in a plugin, the NutchExtensionPoints plugin (they are listed in the NutchExtensionPoints plugin.xml file). Each extension-point defines an interface that must be implemented by the extension. The core extension points are:\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      Point\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Description\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Example\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      IndexWriter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Writes crawled data to a specific indexing backends (Solr, ElasticSearch, a CVS file, etc.).\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      IndexingFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Permits one to add metadata to the indexed fields. All plugins found which implement this extension point are run sequentially on the parse (from javadoc).\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      Parser\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Parser implementations read through fetched documents in order to extract data to be indexed. This is what you need to implement if you want Nutch to be able to parse a new type of content, or extract more data from currently parseable content.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      HtmlParseFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Permits one to add additional metadata to HTML parses (from javadoc).\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      Protocol\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Protocol implementations allow Nutch to use different protocols (ftp, http, etc.) to fetch documents.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      URLFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      URLFilter implementations limit the URLs that Nutch attempts to fetch. The RegexURLFilter distributed with Nutch provides a great deal of control over what URLs Nutch crawls, however if you have very complicated rules about what URLs you want to crawl, you can write your own implementation.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      URLNormalizer\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Interface used to convert URLs to normal form and optionally perform substitutions.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      ScoringFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      A contract defining behavior of scoring plugins. A scoring filter will manipulate scoring variables in CrawlDatum and in resulting search indexes. Filters can be chained in a specific order, to provide multi-stage scoring adjustments.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      SegmentMergeFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Interface used to filter segments during segment merge. It allows filtering on more sophisticated criteria than just URLs. In particular it allows filtering based on metadata collected while parsing page.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Nutch to Use a Plugin\n\n\nIn order to get Nutch to use a given plugin, you need to edit your conf/nutch-site.xml file and add the name of the plugin to the list of plugin.includes. Additionally we are required to add the various build configurations to build.xml in the plugin directory.\n\n\n\nDevelop nutch plugins\n\n\nProject structure of a plugin\n\n\nplugin-name\n  plugin.xml\n  build.xml\n  ivy.xml\n  src\n    org\n      apache\n        nutch\n          indexer\n            uml-meta # source folder\n              URLMetaIndexingFilter.java\n          scoring\n            uml-meta # source folder\n              URLMetaScoringFilter.java\n  test\n    org\n      apache\n        nutch\n          indexer\n            uml-meta # test folder\n              URLMetaIndexingFilterTest.java\n          scoring\n            uml-meta # test folder\n              URLMetaScoringFilterTest.java\n\n\n\n\nFollow \nthis link\n to read develop nutch plugins",

The core Nutch extension-points are themselves defined in a plugin, the NutchExtensionPoints plugin (they are listed in the NutchExtensionPoints plugin.xml file). Each extension-point defines an interface that must be implemented by the extension. The core extension points are:  \n   \n     \n      Point\n     \n\n     \n      Description\n     \n\n     \n      Example\n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      IndexWriter\n     \n\n     \n      Writes crawled data to a specific indexing backends (Solr, ElasticSearch, a CVS file, etc.).\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      IndexingFilter\n     \n\n     \n      Permits one to add metadata to the indexed fields. All plugins found which implement this extension point are run sequentially on the parse (from javadoc).\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      Parser\n     \n\n     \n      Parser implementations read through fetched documents in order to extract data to be indexed. This is what you need to implement if you want Nutch to be able to parse a new type of content, or extract more data from currently parseable content.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      HtmlParseFilter\n     \n\n     \n      Permits one to add additional metadata to HTML parses (from javadoc).\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      Protocol\n     \n\n     \n      Protocol implementations allow Nutch to use different protocols (ftp, http, etc.) to fetch documents.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      URLFilter\n     \n\n     \n      URLFilter implementations limit the URLs that Nutch attempts to fetch. The RegexURLFilter distributed with Nutch provides a great deal of control over what URLs Nutch crawls, however if you have very complicated rules about what URLs you want to crawl, you can write your own implementation.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      URLNormalizer\n     \n\n     \n      Interface used to convert URLs to normal form and optionally perform substitutions.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      ScoringFilter\n     \n\n     \n      A contract defining behavior of scoring plugins.

It persists as long as the web graph that is being crawled (and re-crawled) exists, which may be months or years. The WebDB is used only by the crawler and does not play any role during searching. The WebDB stores two types of entities: pages and links.\n\n\n\nA page\n represents a page on the Web, and is indexed by its URL and the MD5 hash of its contents. Other pertinent information is stored, too, including\n\n\n\n\n\nthe number of links in the page (also called outlinks);\n\n\nfetch information (such as when the page is due to be refetched);\n\n\nthe page's score, which is a measure of how important the page is (for example, one measure of importance awards high scores to pages that are linked to from many other pages).\n\n\n\n\n\nA link\n represents a link from one web page (the source) to another (the target). In the WebDB web graph, the nodes are pages and the edges are links.\n\n\n\nA segment\n is a collection of pages fetched and indexed by the crawler in a single run. The fetchlist for a segment is a list of URLs for the crawler to fetch, and is generated from the WebDB. The fetcher output is the data retrieved from the pages in the fetchlist. The fetcher output for the segment is indexed and the index is stored in the segment. Any given segment has a limited lifespan, since it is obsolete as soon as all of its pages have been re-crawled. The default re-fetch interval is 30 days, so it is usually a good idea to delete segments older than this, particularly as they take up so much disk space. Segments are named by the date and time they were created, so it's easy to tell how old they are.\n\n\n\nThe index\n is the inverted index of all of the pages the system has retrieved, and is created by merging all of the individual segment indexes. Nutch uses Lucene for its indexing, so all of the Lucene tools and APIs are available to interact with the generated index. Since this has the potential to cause confusion, it is worth mentioning that the Lucene index format has a concept of segments, too, and these are different from Nutch segments. A Lucene segment is a portion of a Lucene index, whereas a Nutch segment is a fetched and indexed portion of the WebDB.\n\n\n\nView \ngora-hbase-mapping.xml\n for more details",
