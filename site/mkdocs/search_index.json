A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OO programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] There is significant diversity in object-oriented programming, but most popular languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determines their type.\n\n\n\n\n1. A First Look\n\n\nProcedural vs Object Oriented\n \n1\n\n\n\n\nProcedural Approach\n\n\n\n\nFocus is on procedures\n\n\nAll data is shared: no protection\n\n\nMore difficult to modify\n\n\nHard to manage complexity\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Object Orientation\n\n\n\n\nPeople think in terms of object\n\n\nOO models map to reality \n\n\nOO models are: Easy to develop \n Easy to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Principles\n\n\nencapsulation\n, \ninheritance\n, \nabstraction\n, \npolymorphism\n \n2\n\n\n\nFundamental Principles of OOP In order for a programming language to be object-oriented, it has to enable working with classes and objects as well as the implementation and use of the fundamental object-oriented principles and concepts: inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism.\n\n\n2.1 Encapsulation\n \n3\n \n4\n \n5\n\n\nEncapsulation is the packing of data and functions into a single component. The features of encapsulation are supported using classes in most object-oriented programming languages, although other alternatives also exist. It allows selective hiding of properties and methods in an object by building an impenetrable wall to protect the code from accidental corruption.\n\n\n\n\nWhat it do?\n We will learn to hide unnecessary details in our classes and provide a clear and simple interface for working with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: A popular example you\u2019ll hear for encapsulation is driving a car. Do you need to know exactly how every aspect of a car works (engine, carburettor, alternator, and so on)? No - you need to know how to use the steering wheel, brakes, accelerator, and so on.\n\n\n\n2.2 Inheritance\n \n6\n \n7\n\n\nInheritance is when an object or class is based on another object (prototypal inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), using the same implementation (inheriting from an object or class) specifying implementation to maintain the same behavior (realizing an interface; inheriting behavior).\n\n\n\n\ninherit everything, add data or functionality, override functions, super\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat it do?\n We will explain how class hierarchies improve code readability and enable the reuse of functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: A real-world example of inheritance is genetic inheritance. We all receive genes from both our parents that then define who we are. We share qualities of both our parents, and yet at the same time are different from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: we might classify different kinds of vehicles according to the inheritance hierarchy. Moving down the hierarchy, each kind of vehicle is both more specialized than its parent (and all of its ancestors) and more general than its children (and all of its descendants). A wheeled vehicle inherits properties common to all vehicles (it holds one or more people and carries them from place to place) but has an additional property that makes it more specialized (it has wheels). A car inherits properties common to all wheeled vehicles, but has additional, more specialized properties (four wheels, an engine, a body, and so forth). The inheritance relationship can be viewed as an is-a relationship. In this relationship, the objects become more specialized the lower in the hierarchy you go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the image above you will get a point.\n8\n Yes, the derived class can access base class properties and still the derived class has its own properties.\n\n\n\n2.3 Abstraction\n\n\nIn computer science, abstraction is a technique for managing complexity of computer systems. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level. The programmer works with an idealized interface (usually well defined) and can add additional levels of functionality that would otherwise be too complex to handle.\n\n\n\n\nWhat it do?\n We will learn how to work through abstractions: to deal with objects considering their important characteristics and ignore all other details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: You'll never buy a \"device\", but always buy something more specific : iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Nokia 3310... Here, iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and Nokia 3310 are concrete things, device is abstract.\n\n\n\n2.4 Polymorphism\n \n9\n\n\nPolymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. A polymorphic type is one whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type, or types.\n\n\n\n\nWhat it do?\n We will explain how to work in the same manner with different objects, which define a specific implementation of some abstract behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: All animal can speak, but dogs woof, cats meow, and ducks quack\n\n\n\nThere are two types of polymorphism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverloading (compile time polymorphism): methods have the same name but different parameters.\n\n\nOverriding (run time polymorphism): the implementation given in base class is replaced with that in sub class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n \n10\n: Let us Consider Car example for discussing the polymorphism. Take any brand like Ford, Honda, Toyota, BMW, Benz etc., Everything is  of type Car.\nBut each have their own advanced features and more advanced technology involved in their move behavior.\n\n\n\n3. Concepts\n\n\nLearn Object Oriented Programming though \nMario Game\n\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBbzYKMfx5Y[/embed]\n\n\nHow Mario get \n1up\n\n\n\n\n3.1. Object\n \n11\n\n\n\n  Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.\n\n\n\n\nIn mario world, \nMario is an object.\n\n\n Goomba is an object. \n Koopa is also an object. Even a coin\n and a pile \n are objects\n\n\n\n\n  Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of \nstate\n and related \nbehavior\n.\n\n  An object stores its \nstate\n in \nfields\n (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its \nbehavior\n through \nmethods\n (functions in some programming languages). Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication. Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation \u2014 a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.\n\n\n\n\nIn Mario world, \nMario \n has some fields like position (which indicate where Mario stands), state (which indicate whether Mario alive), and some methods like walk \n, fire or jump.\n\n\n\n\nGoomba \n has some fields like position (which indicate where Goomba stands), state (which indicate whether Goomba die), and direction (which indicate the direction Goomba moves). Goomba has move method, and jumped_on method (which occurs when it is jumped on by Mario) (Poor Goomba!)\n\n\n\nMario Objects, real scene\n\n\n\n3.2 Class\n \n12\n\n\n\n\nIn the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other bicycles in existence, all of the same make and model. Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.\n\n\n\n\nIn Mario world, each coin object come from Coin class, and every Koomba come from Koomba class\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Inheritance\n \n13\n\n\n\n\nInheritance is a mechanism in OOP to design two or more entities that are different but share many common features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature common to all classes are defined in the \nsuperclass\n\n\nThe classes that inherit common features from the \nsuperclass\n are called \nsubclasses\n\n\n\n\nIn Mario World, \nGoomba\n and \nKoopa\n is in\n\n\n\nAND MANY, MANY MORE\n\n\n\n\n3.4. Association, Aggregation and Composition\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nAssociation\n:\n\n\nWhenever two objects are related with each other the relationshiop is called association between object\n\n\nAggregation\n:\n\n\nAggregation is specialized from of association. In aggregation objects have their own life-cycle but there is ownership and child object can not belongs to another parent object. But this is only an ownership not the life-cycle control of child control through parent object.\n\n\nExample: Student and Teacher, Person and address\n\n\nComposition\n\n\nComposition is again specialize form of aggregation and we can call this as `life and death`` relationship. It is a strong type of aggregation. Child object does not have their life-cycle and if parent object is deleted, all child object will also be deleted.\n\n\nExample: House and room\n\n\n3.5 Polymorphism\n \n13\n\n\nPolymorphism indicates the meaning of \"many forms\"\n\n\nPolynorphism present a method that can have many definitions. Polymorphism is related to \"over loading\" and \"over ridding\".\n\n\nOverloading indicates a method can have different definitions by defining different type of parameters.\n\n\n[code]\ngetPrice(): void\ngetPrice(string name): void\n[/code]\n\n\n3.6 Abstraction\n \n13\n\n\nAbstraction is the process of modelling only relevant features\n\n\n\n\nHide unnecessary details which are irrelevant for current purpose.\n\n\n\n\nReduces complexity and aids understanding.\n\n\nAbstraction provides the freedom to defer implementation decisions by avoiding commitments to details.\n\n\n3.7 Interface\n \n13\n\n\nAn interface is a contract consisting of group of related function prototypes whose usage is defined but whose implementation is not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interface definition specifies the interface's member functions, called methods, their return types, the number and types of parameters and what they must do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese is no implementation associated with an interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Coupling and Cohesion\n\n\n13\n\n\n4.1 Coupling\n\n\nCoupling defines how dependent one object on another object (that is uses).\n\n\nCoupling is a measure of strength of connection between any two system components. The more any one components knows about other components, the tighter (worse) the coupling is between those components.\n\n\n4.2 Cohesion\n\n\nCohesion defines how narrowly defined an object is. Functional cohesion refers measures how strongly objects are related.\n\n\nCohesion is a measure of how logically related the parts of an individual components are to each other, and to the overall components. The more logically related the parts of components are to each other higher (better) the cohesion of that components.\n\n\n4.3 Object Oriented Design\n\n\nLow coupling and tight cohesion is good object oriented design.\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n\nTask 1\n: With boiler plate code, make an gif image (32x32) Mario fire ball and jump to get coins\n\n\n5.

The arrowheads are typically confused with data flow and as a result I avoid their use. \n(example)\n\n\nExtend\n: Extend is a directed relationship that specifies how and when the behavior defined in usually supplementary (optional) extending use case can be inserted into the behavior defined in the extended use case. \n(example)\n\n\nInclude\n is a directed relationship between two use cases which is used to show that behavior of the included use case (the addition) is inserted into the behavior of the including (the base) use case. \n(example)\n\n\nSystem boundary boxes\n (optional). You can draw a rectangle around the use cases, called the system boundary box, to indicates the scope of your system.

An actor is a person, organization, or external system that plays a role in one or more interactions with your system. Actors are drawn as stick figures.  (example)  Associations.
